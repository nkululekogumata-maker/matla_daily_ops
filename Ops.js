PRODUCT OVERVIEW

We exist in a market that is very insurance reliant. Life is extremely spontaneous and it is vital to prepare for inconsistencies. Due to limited information and unethical brokers, funeral policies are overused. This has led to multiple funeral policies and rising premiums.
With our partnership with RMA, we provide a solution that relieves the client financially and improves convenience by consolidating policies.

<span id="jfa-obtaining"></span>
OBTAINING
The Consolidated Funeral Plan is a replacement product. Obtaining is the collection of a client's policy schedules from current insurers so the FA can draft a correct quotation.
1. What is to obtain?
- Collect policy schedules/policy documents from current insurers
2. Importance
- Needed to draft accurate quotations
- Avoid consolidating/cancelling wrong policies
3. What are policy schedules?
- Documents with client policy details: type, insured lives, cover amounts, start dates, etc.
4. How to obtain?
- Conference calling: insurer verifies with client
- Online portal: OTP access to policy info
- Client documents: copies already held by client
5. Who does it?
- Admin support or FA; JFAs can be trained to assist

[Back to top](#jfa-top)

<span id="jfa-afford"></span>
AFFORDABILITY
Government allows only 15% of basic salary to be deducted by insurance.
1. What is affordability?
- The allowable 15% deduction limit
2. Why it matters?
- Determines whether a policy can go in force
3. How to calculate?
- Example: 15% of R20k = R3000
- If current policies already deduct R2000, available is R1000
- If quote is R1200, affordability fails
4. When to check?
- After quotation is done

NB: If a client has only 1 funeral cover, we may not save them money. We add value with increased cover and services.

[Back to top](#jfa-top)

<span id="jfa-cancel"></span>
CANCELLATIONS
Cancellations prevent double debits and enable affordability.
1. What are cancellations?
- Termination of existing policies being replaced
2. Why important?
- Avoid double debits
- Create affordability
- Enable refunds if double debited
3. What is a double debit?
- Old insurer and RMA both debit in same cycle
4. Who does cancellations?
- FA, admin support, or the client
5. How?
- Email cancellation request
- Conference call for immediate termination
- Branch walk-ins for formal cancellation and refunds

        marketing: `Imagine This 🎨
Picture a busy marketplace in ancient times. Stalls line the street, each selling something different: spices, fabrics, tools. Every merchant is shouting, waving, or arranging their goods to catch the eye of passersby.
Now, some merchants are chaotic—yelling randomly, changing prices every hour, or forgetting to show up. Others have a system:
• They know when to open and close.
• They display goods in a neat, attractive way.
• They have a routine for greeting customers.
• They track which products sell best and adjust accordingly.
That organized routine is what we call a marketing system today. It’s not just shouting “buy my stuff!”—it’s a structured way of attracting, engaging, and keeping customers.

Breaking It Down Step by Step
Think of a marketing system as a machine with gears. Each gear represents a part of the process, and when they all turn smoothly, the business grows.
1. Awareness Gear
• Purpose: Make people notice you exist.
• Modern Example: Ads on Instagram, flyers, or word-of-mouth.
• Marketplace Analogy: The merchant places colorful fabrics at the front of the stall to catch attention.
2. Interest Gear
• Purpose: Spark curiosity.
• Modern Example: A free sample, a catchy slogan, or a blog post.
• Marketplace Analogy: The spice seller lets you smell a pinch of cinnamon.
3. Decision Gear
• Purpose: Help people choose you over competitors.
• Modern Example: Discounts, testimonials, or clear explanations of benefits.
• Marketplace Analogy: The fabric seller shows how durable the cloth is compared to others.
4. Purchase Gear
• Purpose: Make buying easy and pleasant.
• Modern Example: Smooth checkout, multiple payment options.
• Marketplace Analogy: The merchant wraps your goods neatly and thanks you.
5. Retention Gear
• Purpose: Keep customers coming back.
• Modern Example: Loyalty programs, follow-up emails, personalized offers.
• Marketplace Analogy: The spice seller remembers your favorite blend and offers you a deal next time.

Why It Matters
Without a system, marketing is like throwing darts blindfolded—you might hit the target once, but most of the time you waste effort. With a system, every dart is aimed carefully, and you can measure how close you’re getting.
• Predictability: You know what works and can repeat it.
• Efficiency: Less wasted time and money.
• Growth: Systems scale—what works for 10 customers can be expanded to 1,000.

Vivid Example in Today’s World
Imagine you’re selling handmade sneakers online:
• Awareness: TikTok videos showing your designs.
• Interest: A blog post about how your sneakers are eco-friendly.
• Decision: Reviews from happy customers.
• Purchase: A clean website with “Buy Now” buttons.
• Retention: A thank-you email with a discount for their next pair.
That’s a marketing system in action—it’s the invisible engine behind every successful business.

Quick Tips
• Keep a simple tracker: Awareness → Interest → Decision → Purchase → Retention.
• Improve one gear at a time (don’t fix everything at once).
• Review results weekly and adjust your message or channel.`,
        loa: `The Core Idea 🎯
The Law of Averages is the belief that if you repeat an action enough times, the results will eventually balance out to a predictable ratio.
Think of it like planting seeds: not every seed grows, but if you plant enough, you’ll see a pattern.

Step-by-Step Breakdown
1. The Ratio (1:10)
• In sales, people often say: “For every 10 people you talk to, 1 will buy.”
• That’s the Law of Averages in action—you don’t know which person will say yes, but you know the ratio will hold if you keep trying.
2. Short-Term Chaos
• If you only talk to 2 people, both might say no.
• That doesn’t mean the system is broken—it just means you haven’t given the averages enough chances to show themselves.
3. Long-Term Balance
• Over 100 conversations, you’ll likely see about 10 sales.
• The more you repeat, the closer you get to the expected ratio.

Vivid Example 🌍
Imagine you’re a street performer juggling to attract tips:
• You perform for 10 groups of people.
• 9 groups clap but walk away.
• 1 group drops money in your hat.
That’s the 1:10 ratio. If you stop after 3 groups, you might think, “This doesn’t work.” But if you keep going, the averages kick in.

Why It Matters
• In Sales: It teaches persistence. Don’t quit after a few rejections—your “yes” is hiding in the averages.
• In Life: It reminds us that effort compounds. Success isn’t about one lucky break; it’s about showing up enough times for the odds to work in your favor.
• In Business: It helps forecast results. If you know your ratio, you can predict outcomes (e.g., 100 calls → 10 sales → R1,000 profit).

Marketplace Analogy 🏺
Back to our ancient marketplace:
• A spice seller knows that out of every 10 people who stop at his stall, 1 will buy.
• He doesn’t chase the 9 who walk away—he focuses on talking to more people, because the ratio guarantees results over time.

Quick Tips
• Track your ratio weekly (e.g., 1:8 or 1:12).
• Focus on volume and consistency, not perfection.
• Celebrate effort milestones, not just wins.`,
        five: `5 Steps ⚙️
Step 1: Intro
• Meaning: This is your opening move—breaking the ice and making contact.
• Analogy: Think of a merchant in the marketplace smiling and saying, “Welcome, traveler!” before showing his goods.
• Ratio in Action: Out of 10 intros, maybe only 1 person will stop and listen—but that’s enough to start the process.

Step 2: Short Story
• Meaning: A quick, engaging explanation that builds curiosity. It’s not the full pitch—just a teaser.
• Analogy: A spice seller says, “These cinnamon sticks come from the mountains—rare and full of flavor.”
• Ratio in Action: Out of 10 short stories, 1 person will lean in and want to hear more.

Step 3: Presentation
• Meaning: This is the main pitch—showing the product or service clearly, with benefits highlighted.
• Analogy: The tailor lays out the suit, lets you feel the fabric, and explains why it lasts longer.
• Ratio in Action: Out of 10 presentations, 1 person will be convinced enough to move forward.

Step 4: Close
• Meaning: Asking directly for the sale. This is where persistence matters—you don’t leave it vague.
• Analogy: The merchant says, “Shall I wrap this up for you?” instead of waiting for you to decide silently.
• Ratio in Action: Out of 10 closes, 1 person will say yes. The other 9 may hesitate, but the averages guarantee that one will commit.

Step 5: Rehash
• Meaning: After the sale, reinforce the decision and open the door for future sales. It’s about maximizing the relationship.
• Analogy: The spice seller, after selling cinnamon, says, “Next time, you might enjoy our nutmeg—it pairs beautifully.”
• Ratio in Action: Out of 10 rehashes, 1 person will buy again or refer someone else.

Putting It All Together 🌍
The Law of Averages says:
• If you repeat these 5 steps consistently, the ratio (like 1:10) will reveal itself.
• You don’t know which person will be the “yes,” but you know that if you keep moving through the steps, the numbers will balance out.
• Example: If you want 20 sales, you’ll need about 200 full cycles of Intro → Short Story → Presentation → Close → Rehash.

Quick Tips
• Write one strong line for each step and practice it daily.
• Keep the “Short Story” under 20 seconds.
• Always end with a clear next step (a question or invitation).`,
        eight: `1. Identify Your Target Market (WHO you serve)

What this means:
You must clearly define who your ideal customer is before you try to sell anything.

Why this matters:
You cannot sell to everyone. If you try, your message becomes weak and confusing.

Key questions to ask:

Who has the problem my product solves?

What age, gender, job, income level?

Where do they spend time (online or offline)?

What frustrates them?

Example:
If you sell a fitness program:

❌ “People who want to get fit”

✅ “Busy professionals aged 25–40 who want to lose weight without going to the gym”

Marketing rule:

If you don’t know exactly who you’re talking to, no one listens.

2. Understand the Customer’s Problem (WHY they care)

What this means:
You must deeply understand the pain, fear, or desire your customer is experiencing.

People don’t buy products.
They buy solutions to problems or paths to desired outcomes.

Types of problems:

Physical – weight, health, money

Emotional – stress, fear, insecurity

Social – status, approval, confidence

Example:
A person doesn’t buy a laptop because it’s fast.
They buy it because:

Their old one wastes time

They feel embarrassed at work

They want to be more productive

Marketing rule:

The stronger the pain you address, the easier the sale.

3. Create a Compelling Offer (WHAT you sell)

What this means:
An offer is not just a product.
It is everything the customer gets, packaged to feel valuable and low-risk.

A strong offer includes:

The product or service

Bonuses (extras)

Guarantees

Price

Clear outcome

Example:
❌ “Online trading course – R2,000”
✅ “8-week beginner trading course + live mentorship + risk management templates + 30-day money-back guarantee”

Why this matters:
People don’t compare prices — they compare perceived value.

Marketing rule:

Make your offer so good people feel stupid saying no.

4. Craft Your Message (HOW you communicate)

What this means:
You now translate the customer’s problem and your offer into simple, emotional language.

Your message must answer:

What problem do you solve?

Who is this for?

How does life improve after using this?

Why should they trust you?

Good messaging uses:

Simple words (no jargon)

Emotion

Benefits, not features

Example:
❌ “Our software uses advanced algorithms”
✅ “Finish your work in half the time without stress”

Marketing rule:

Clarity beats cleverness every time.

5. Choose Your Marketing Channels (WHERE you show up)

What this means:
You decide where to place your message so the right people actually see it.

Common channels:

Social media (Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn)

Email

Websites & landing pages

Ads

Word of mouth

Key idea:
Your customers already hang out somewhere.
You go there, not the other way around.

Example:

Professionals → LinkedIn

Young audience → TikTok / Instagram

Businesses → Email

Marketing rule:

Be where your customers already are.

6. Capture Leads (TURN attention into contact)

What this means:
A lead is someone who has shown interest and given you a way to contact them.

This is critical because most people won’t buy immediately.

Common ways to capture leads:

Free guide or checklist

Free consultation

Email newsletter

Free trial

Example:
“Download our free beginner trading checklist”
→ Customer gives email
→ Now you can follow up

Marketing rule:

Attention is rented. Leads are owned.

7. Nurture Trust & Build Relationship (MAKE them comfortable)

What this means:
You educate, help, and build trust before asking for the sale.

People buy from:

Brands they trust

People they understand

Solutions they believe will work

How to nurture:

Emails with useful tips

Social proof (testimonials)

Educational content

Stories

Example:
Before selling a fitness program:

Teach basic exercises

Share success stories

Explain common mistakes

Marketing rule:

Trust is built before money is exchanged.

8. Close the Sale & Retain the Customer (GET paid & keep them)

What this means:
You clearly ask for the sale and then focus on keeping the customer happy.

Closing the sale:

Clear call-to-action (“Buy now”, “Book a call”)

Remove friction (simple checkout)

Reassure with guarantees

Retention is crucial because:

Repeat customers cost less

They refer others

They increase lifetime value

After the sale:

Deliver results

Follow up

Upsell or cross-sell responsibly

Marketing rule:

The easiest sale is the second sale.

The Entire System in One Flow

Who are you selling to?

What problem do they have?

What solution do you offer?

How do you explain it clearly?

Where do you reach them?

How do you capture interest?

How do you build trust?

How do you close and retain?

Quick Tips
• Write a one-line offer for each step to keep your message clear.
• Keep one primary channel per campaign (don’t scatter effort).
• Track one lead metric (leads, calls, demos) and one conversion metric.`,
        fugi: `The FUGI framework explains why people say “yes”.
It focuses on the psychological drivers behind buying decisions.

FUGI = Fear, Urgency, Greed, Indifference

Every buying decision is influenced by one or more of these forces—whether people realize it or not.

1. Fear – “What happens if I DON’T act?”
What Fear means in sales

Fear is the desire to avoid pain, loss, or negative consequences.

Humans are wired to avoid loss more strongly than they seek gain.

People buy to:

Avoid missing out

Prevent failure

Protect themselves

Reduce uncertainty

Common fears customers have

Losing money

Wasting time

Falling behind others

Making the wrong decision

Being embarrassed or judged

Example

A person doesn’t buy antivirus software because it’s “advanced.”
They buy because they’re afraid of:

Getting hacked

Losing personal data

Financial theft

How marketers ethically use Fear

Highlight risks of inaction

Show consequences clearly (not exaggerated)

Position your product as protection

Example message:
“If you don’t manage your finances now, you’ll still be stuck paycheck-to-paycheck five years from now.”

Key rule

Fear motivates action faster than pleasure.

2. Urgency – “Why must I act NOW?”
What Urgency means in sales

Urgency removes procrastination.

Most people delay decisions even when they want something.
Urgency answers the question:

“Why not later?”

Why urgency works

Humans prioritize immediate threats and opportunities

Time limits force decisions

Scarcity increases perceived value

Common urgency triggers

Limited time offers

Limited stock

Deadlines

Price increases

Example

People often want to get fit “eventually.”
Urgency converts that into:

“Start today”

“Offer ends tonight”

“Only 5 spots left”

Ethical urgency vs manipulation

Ethical:

Real deadlines

Genuine limits

Honest scarcity

Unethical:

Fake countdown timers

False “last chance” claims

Key rule

Without urgency, interest dies.

3. Greed – “What do I GAIN?”

(Greed here does not mean selfishness — it means desire for improvement.)

What Greed means in sales

Greed is the desire for:

More money

Better results

Higher status

Easier life

Faster outcomes

People are drawn to upside potential.

Examples of greed-based motivations

“Make more money”

“Save time”

“Increase confidence”

“Get ahead of others”

“Live better with less effort”

Example

Someone buys a trading course because:

They want financial freedom

They want extra income

They want control over their time

How marketers use Greed

Focus on benefits and outcomes

Emphasize ROI (Return on Investment)

Show transformation (before → after)

Example message:
“Turn your spare time into an extra R10,000 per month.”

Key rule

People buy outcomes, not processes.

4. Indifference – “Why should I care at all?”
What Indifference means in sales

Indifference is the default state of your audience.

Most people:

Aren’t thinking about you

Aren’t actively shopping

Don’t feel emotional yet

Your first job in marketing is to break indifference.

Why indifference is the biggest obstacle

If someone doesn’t care:

Fear doesn’t work

Urgency doesn’t work

Greed doesn’t work

They must first be engaged emotionally or intellectually.

How to overcome indifference

Be relevant

Speak directly to their situation

Use patterns they recognize

Ask compelling questions

Example

❌ “We offer business consulting services”
✅ “Most small businesses fail because of one mistake—are you making it?”

Key rule

If you don’t interrupt indifference, nothing else matters.

How FUGI Works Together (Very Important)

People rarely buy for only one factor.

Most decisions look like this:

Fear of staying the same

Greed for a better outcome

Urgency to act now

Indifference already broken by relevance

Example: Fitness Program

Fear: “I’m getting unhealthy”

Greed: “I want confidence and energy”

Urgency: “Summer is in 8 weeks”

Indifference: Broken by “This program is for busy people who hate gyms”

FUGI Applied to a Simple Sales Message

“If you don’t take control of your money now (Fear), you’ll still be struggling years from today.
This system helps beginners grow steady income (Greed) without quitting their job.
Enrollment closes Friday (Urgency).
If you’re tired of being stuck, this is for you (Indifference broken).”

Why FUGI Is So Powerful

It explains human behavior, not tactics

It works in ads, emails, conversations, pitches

It applies to any product or service

It aligns with how the brain actually makes decisions

One-Sentence Summary

People buy when they care (Indifference), want more (Greed), fear loss (Fear), and feel compelled to act now (Urgency).

Quick Tips
• Use 1–2 FUGI angles per message (not all four at once).
• Be ethical with urgency (real deadlines only).
• Always show the “safe next step” to reduce fear.`,
        impulse: `The IMPULSE framework explains why people buy in the moment, often emotionally first and logically later.

IMPULSE = Immediacy, Momentum, Proof, Simplicity, Emotion

These factors reduce thinking friction and accelerate decisions.

1. Immediacy – “I want it NOW”
What Immediacy means in sales

Immediacy is the desire for instant gratification.

Humans naturally prefer:

Fast results over slow results

Convenience over effort

Instant reward over delayed reward

Why immediacy works

The brain discounts future rewards.
The closer the reward feels, the more valuable it becomes.

Examples

Same-day delivery

Instant access after payment

“Start in 5 minutes”

“Download immediately”

Example message

“Get access instantly—no waiting, no setup.”

Key rule

The shorter the time to reward, the higher the conversion.

2. Momentum – “I’ve already started, I might as well continue”
What Momentum means in sales

Momentum is the psychological tendency to continue once action has begun.

Once someone says “yes” to a small action, a bigger “yes” becomes easier.

Why momentum works

Commitment creates consistency

Small actions reduce resistance

Progress feels good

Examples

Free trials

Step-by-step onboarding

Low-commitment entry offers

Example

A free checklist → email signup → low-cost product → premium offer

Example message

“You’re already halfway there—finish setting this up.”

Key rule

Action creates more action.

3. Proof – “Others are doing it, so it must be safe”
What Proof means in sales

People look to others to decide what’s correct—especially when unsure.

This is called social proof.

Types of proof

Testimonials

Reviews

Case studies

User counts

Before-and-after stories

Why proof works

Reduces risk

Builds trust fast

Normalizes the decision

Example

“Trusted by 25,000 users”
“4.8-star rating from real customers”

Key rule

If people like me succeeded, I probably will too.

4. Simplicity – “This looks easy”
What Simplicity means in sales

Complexity kills impulse.

If something looks:

Confusing

Technical

Time-consuming

People hesitate or leave.

Why simplicity works

The brain avoids effort.
Clear, simple choices feel safer.

Examples

One-click checkout


Clear pricing

Plain language

Step-by-step explanations

Example message

“3 simple steps. No experience required.”

Key rule

Confused minds do not buy.

5. Emotion – “This feels right”
What Emotion means in sales

Emotion is the engine behind impulse buying.

Logic justifies the purchase after the decision is made.

Core buying emotions

Hope

Excitement

Relief

Confidence

Belonging

Examples

Inspiring stories

Transformation imagery

Identity-based messaging

Example message

“Imagine waking up confident, energized, and in control.”

Key rule

People buy emotionally and defend logically.

How IMPULSE Factors Work Together

Impulse purchases rarely rely on one factor alone.

A typical impulse decision looks like this:

Emotion sparks desire

Simplicity removes friction

Proof removes fear

Immediacy pulls the trigger

Momentum carries them through checkout

IMPULSE Applied to a Simple Sales Message

“Start today and get instant access (Immediacy).
Join 12,000 beginners already using this system (Proof).
Set it up in 10 minutes—no experience needed (Simplicity).
You’re already closer to freedom than you think (Momentum + Emotion).”

How IMPULSE Differs from FUGI (Important)

FUGI explains why people care

IMPULSE explains why they act immediately

They work best together.

One-Sentence Summary

Impulse buying happens when emotions are high, effort is low, proof is strong, rewards are immediate, and action is already in motion.

Quick Tips
• Reduce steps (less clicking = more conversions).
• Add proof near the call-to-action (reviews, numbers).
• Use clear, simple wording for the next step.`,

Focus on system and goals, not money or bell.
Set territory loops toward each other; meet up regularly.
Check tick sheet, attitude, work ethic, territory.
Expect negatives and overturn them (e.g. rehash territory).

        cross: `CROSS-SELLING

Core Definition
Cross-selling is using multiple relevant products or services to meet one client's financial needs in a more complete way.

What this means in practice:
- You do not force extra sales.
- You identify real needs and match suitable products.
- You improve client outcomes while increasing consultant productivity.

Why Cross-Selling Matters
From your training notes:
- It helps properly service the client.
- It allows a consultant to maximize selling opportunities.
- It positions the consultant, client, and business more favorably financially and operationally.
- It increases earning potential through better service delivery.

Expanded value:
1. Better client protection:
   One product rarely solves every risk. A smarter bundle creates stronger financial resilience.
2. Better retention:
   Clients with multiple relevant products are less likely to cancel.
3. Better trust:
   Clients feel advised, not sold to, when recommendations are connected to their goals.
4. Better long-term income:
   Stronger portfolios, cleaner verifications, and better persistency improve results over time.

What Is Cross-Selling?
Use multiple products and services to meet a client's financial objectives and close risk gaps.

Simple model:
- Primary need -> Primary product
- Secondary need -> Supporting product
- Future need -> Follow-up product

Example:
Client wants funeral cover today.
You also identify debt pressure and income risk.
You recommend:
- Funeral product for immediate family burden protection
- Suitable consolidation option for premium efficiency
- Follow-up life solution for income replacement planning

Why It Is Important To Cross-Sell
1. Gives the client options:
   Clients can choose according to affordability and urgency.
2. Improves financial insight:
   You help client understand where money leaks and where protection is missing.
3. Increases revenue ethically:
   More suitable solutions means more value delivered and more business growth.
4. Strengthens after-sales:
   Service quality improves when product decisions were intentional from day one.

Who Cross-Sells?
Lifestyle Consultant
- Leads the needs analysis and structured consultation.
- Uses multiple products intentionally where relevant.

Verification Team
- Reinforces value after point of sale.
- Flags deferred needs where a client asked to revisit later.
- Supports continuity between sale, onboarding, and service.

How To Cross-Sell (Operational Workflow)
1. Training first
- Know each product deeply: eligibility, exclusions, premium logic, claim process, and ideal client profile.
- If product knowledge is weak, do not pitch it yet.

2. Survey before pitch
- During meet-and-greet, complete a needs survey.
- Capture family structure, income realities, current cover, debt pressure, and financial goals.

3. Structured consultation
- Use consultation guidelines to keep the conversation intentional.
- Move from discovery -> gap analysis -> recommendation -> confirmation.

4. Customer service follow-through
- Post-sale service builds trust.
- Clients are more open to additional relevant products when they experience real support.

5. Verification touchpoint
- Confirm client understanding.
- Revisit deferred opportunities with permission.

When To Cross-Sell
From your training notes:
- During all consultations.
- During verifications and customer service.

Working rhythm:

In practical terms:
- Matla Life supports clients with financial planning and life insurance solutions

They are separate companies in a strategic partnership model:

This creates a full estate and insurance ecosystem.

What Makes Capital Legacy Different
Traditional model in South Africa:
- will drafted by attorney
- death occurs
- family waits 1 to 3 years for final estate outcomes
- executor fees can be high

Capital Legacy's model is designed to:
- reduce delays
- provide immediate liquidity for family
- control executor costs
- bundle services into one structured solution

Their Services - Full Detail
1) Drafting Your Will (Core Foundation Service)
They create a legally valid and professionally structured will designed to:
- handle complex family structures
- protect minor children
- create testamentary trusts at death
- structure asset distribution more efficiently

Result: the will becomes a legal and financial strategy tool.

2) Executor of Your Estate
After death, they can execute:
- reporting to the Master of the High Court
- asset collection and valuation
- debt settlement
- SARS process management
- inheritance distribution

Why this matters:
- avoids delays and conflict when no executor is pre-appointed
- improves process certainty for the family

3) Immediate Cash for Your Family (Liquidity Solution)
Common estate problem:
- bank accounts are frozen
- policy payouts can take time
- estates can take months/years

Capital Legacy structures liquidity planning so family can:
- receive support quickly
- pay funeral costs
- maintain daily living needs

Often linked to life cover planning.

4) Testamentary Trusts (Minor Children and Dependants)
For beneficiaries under 18 or dependants unable to self-manage funds:
- trust activates at death
- inheritance is protected
- payouts are controlled
- misuse risk is reduced

5) Living Trusts (Asset Protection While Alive)
Used to:
- move assets outside personal estate

- property transfer process
- final distributions to heirs

This process can run long; they execute it on behalf of the family.

7) Beneficiary Fund Solutions

- funds are managed professionally
- controlled income can be paid out
- capital can remain protected

8) Secure Document Storage
They secure:
- original will
- key legal and estate documents

This reduces common risk:
- will not found
- wrong will used
- intestate outcomes

9) Legacy Protection Plan (Bundled Model)
Typically includes:
- will drafting
- executor appointment
- estate liquidity planning
- trust planning
- administration cost planning

This makes estate planning a structured, pre-funded system instead of a once-off legal event.

How They Make Money
Revenue can come from:
- structured service fees
- estate administration fees
- fiduciary service fees
- partner distribution models

Model objective:
- reduce heavy surprise costs later
- structure and spread costs earlier where possible

The Real Value They Provide
Without planning:
- families can wait years for money

- estate value is reduced by delays and poor structure

With proper Capital Legacy structuring:
- families can receive faster support
- inheritance can be protected
- costs are controlled better
- execution is professional and more predictable

One Powerful Sentence

        life: `Life Cover - JFA Learning Hub

CHAPTER 1
What Is Life Cover Really? (The Financial & Human Meaning)

1.1 The core definition
Life cover (life insurance) is a financial risk transfer mechanism.
You transfer the financial risk of your death to an insurer.
In exchange for a premium, the insurer promises to pay a lump sum when you die.

1.2 The real problem life cover solves
When a person dies, 4 economic shocks happen immediately:
- Income stops
- Debt remains
- Dependants still need support
- Funeral costs arise

Life cover replaces the economic value of a human life.
Not emotionally, financially.

1.3 Human Life Value (HLV) concept
Your life has a measurable financial value based on:
- Your income
- Years left to work
- Future growth
- Number of dependants

Example:
Age: 30
Income: R20,000/month
Working years left: 35
Future earnings are about R8.4 million+.
That is your economic life value.
Life cover is designed to protect that value.

1.4 Two foundational models of life cover
Individual life cover:
- You own the policy
- You choose the cover amount
- You keep it if you change jobs

Group life cover (like RMA):
- Employer owns the master policy
- Employer sets benefits
- Employees are covered as members

CHAPTER 2
The Mathematics and Structure of Life Cover

2.1 The pricing model (how insurers calculate your premium)
Life cover pricing is based on mortality risk (probability of death by age).
Insurers use mortality tables and consider:
- Age
- Gender
- Health
- Smoking status
- Occupation

Risk logic example:
- A 25-year-old usually has lower probability of death and cheaper premium.
- A 55-year-old usually has higher probability and higher premium.

2.2 The 3 components of a life premium
Premium has three main components:
1) Cost of insurance (pure risk cost)
2) Expenses (admin, commission, operations)
3) Profit margin

2.3 Types of life cover structures
Level cover:
- Cover amount stays the same
- Premium usually increases over time

Increasing cover:
- Cover grows with inflation
- Protects real value over time

Decreasing cover:
- Common for home loans/business loans
- Debt reduces over time, so cover can reduce

2.4 The payout mechanics
When death occurs:
- Claim is submitted
- Documents are provided (death certificate, IDs, beneficiary details)
- Insurer validates the claim
- Lump sum is paid (generally tax-free in South Africa context)

2.5 Why payout is a lump sum
Because funds may need to:
- Settle debts immediately
- Generate income for dependants
- Pay for education
- Fund long-term living costs

It acts as a capital replacement fund.

CHAPTER 3
RMA LIFE COVER - Deep Technical Structure

3.1 Group risk pool concept
In RMA, many workers are insured together.
This creates:
- Shared risk
- Lower cost
- Broader access

This is collective underwriting:
RMA underwrites the workforce risk pool, not each person the same way as retail individual cover.

3.2 How life cover amount is determined
Many RMA schemes use a salary multiple formula, for example:
- 2 x annual salary
- 3 x annual salary
- 5 x annual salary

Example:
Monthly salary = R18,000
Annual salary = R216,000
At 3x, life cover = R648,000

Salary-based cover links directly to income replacement capacity.

3.3 Who pays for the cover?
Operationally, employer pays premiums to RMA.
Economically, it is part of employee total cost to company.

3.4 Underwriting advantage
Individual life cover can require medical evidence.
RMA group life often gives automatic cover up to a Free Cover Limit (FCL).
Example:
- First R500,000 may be covered without medicals
- Amount above FCL may require medical underwriting

3.5 What happens when leaving employment?
Group life cover generally stops when employment ends.
Some schemes allow continuation options if action is taken in time.

3.6 Why group cover may be insufficient on its own
Example:
- Salary: R240,000/year
- Group cover: 3x = R720,000
- Full economic value may be far higher

So group cover is often a base layer, not complete protection.

3.7 Beneficiary system
Members should complete a nomination form.
If no nomination exists, distribution may follow dependency/legal processes, which can delay payout.

MASTER SUMMARY
Life cover is not only about death, it is about:
- Replacing income
- Protecting dependants
- Preserving dignity
- Reducing long-term financial hardship

In RMA context, life cover is:
- Salary-linked capital replacement
- Employer-sponsored
- Cost-efficient via group risk pooling

Important: it may still need to be complemented by broader personal financial planning.`,

2) Step 1 - Complete Policy Holder Details
Slide anchor: "Complete Policy holder details"

What to do:
- Capture policyholder personal details exactly as on official ID.

- Policyholder must always be covered first.
- You cannot sell family benefit without policyholder cover.
- Add lives assured only after main policyholder cover is valid.

Execution checklist:
- Start with policyholder cover.
- Add spouse/dependants where relevant.
- Confirm each life category and benefit amount.
- Recheck totals before moving forward.

Common error to avoid:
- Trying to structure family-only cover without main member cover.

4) Step 2A - Affordability Gate
Slide anchor: "Check Affordability before you can continue... Even when client does not afford"

What this means:
- Affordability is not optional.
- You should still complete a proper quote flow even if affordability initially fails, because the client may be serviced later.

Best practice:
- Explain affordability result in plain language.
- Keep the quote record complete and compliant.
- Set expectation on next steps (rework/revisit).

Talk-track:
"Right now affordability is not passing. We can still keep this structured so we can revisit once your affordability changes or after we optimize your setup."

5) Step 3 - Select Beneficiaries
Slide anchors:
- "Selecting Beneficiaries"
- "Save and confirm contact details"

What to do:
- Capture beneficiary(ies) accurately.
- Save and verify all beneficiary contact details.
- Confirm relationship to policyholder.
- Confirm who receives what in practical terms.

Quality control:
- Read details back to client before confirming.
- Avoid spelling/ID errors that can delay claims.

6) Step 3A - Confirmation Handling
Slide anchor: "Confirm no longer accepts the policy"

Scenario:
- Client changes mind or does not accept at confirmation.

What to do:
- Do not force close.
- Capture status cleanly as not accepted.
- Save notes for follow-up and objection handling.

Advisor standard:
- Protect trust first; a clean "not now" can become a future "yes".

7) Step 4 - New Business Application
Slide anchors:
- "Your New Policy Number"
- "Confirm that all details are correct"
- "Final Check"

What to do:
- Generate/confirm new policy number.
- Perform full final verification with client:
  identity, cover, lives assured, beneficiaries, deduction details, contact details.
- Do a full final check before signature.

Final-check framework:
- Is the right person insured as policyholder?
- Are all cover values correct?
- Are beneficiary details complete?
- Is affordability outcome understood?
- Is payment timing understood?

8) Signature and Location Capture
Slide anchors:
- "System Captures Client Signature"
- "Complete location that the client signed at"

Non-negotiables:
- Signature must be captured through the system.
- Signing location must be captured correctly.

Why:
- Compliance and audit trail.
- Protects both client and business.

Do not:
- Backdate or misstate location.
- Skip signature quality checks.

9) Plan Submission and Issuing
Slide anchors:
- "Plan Submission submits and issues the policy if affordability is passed"

Rule:
- Issuance happens when submission is complete and affordability passes.

Before pressing submit:
- Confirm no pending corrections.
- Confirm client consent and understanding.
- Confirm capture completeness.

After submit:
- Confirm issued status.
- Confirm policy number with client.
- Set next communication step.

10) If Affordability Fails
Slide anchors:
- "What if my policy fails affordability?"
- "We have you covered"

Recovery pathway:
- Keep the quote and signed process trail where applicable.
- Return later to reassess affordability.
- Re-run the flow and issue once criteria are met.

Business benefit:
- Prevents losing warm clients just because timing was wrong.

11) Consolidation then Return
Slide anchor:
- "What if I want to do consolidation and then come back afterwards?"

Operational approach:
- Handle consolidation first where it improves affordability/value.
- Re-open policy application journey afterwards.
- Re-check affordability and complete issuance.

Talk-track:
"Let's optimize your existing setup first, then we come back and finalize this plan from a stronger position."

12) Revisit Flow for Previously Non-Affording Client
Slide anchors:
- "You can now go back to clients that initially didn't afford..."
- "Simply go through these steps again"

Revisit SOP:
1. Open existing policy application/quote trail.
2. Validate if client circumstances changed.
3. Re-check affordability.
4. Re-confirm all captured data.
5. Re-capture consent where needed.
6. Submit and issue if passed.

13) Express Will Stage
Slide anchors:
- "Express will..." (multiple slides)

Field interpretation:
- There is an additional express-will component in the journey.
- Treat it as an add-on process that must be explained clearly.

When handling this stage:
- Explain purpose and value in simple language.
- Confirm client understanding before acceptance.
- Capture choices and consent accurately.

14) Compliance and Quality Guardrails
Always do:
- Tell the truth about deductions and existing policy impacts.
- Keep affordability transparent.
- Capture signature and location properly.
- Confirm all details before submission.
- Document client decision status clearly.

Never do:
- Hide second deduction implications.
- Push through when client does not accept.
- Skip final check.
- Submit with known data errors.

15) Consultant Performance Scorecard for Matla Plan
Use this to improve consistency:
- Data quality score (errors found post-submit).
- Affordability pass rate.
- Issuance conversion rate.
- Revisit conversion (failed -> issued later).
- Complaint-free cases.

16) Objection Handling (Quick Bank)
"I already have cover."
- "That's valid. Let's compare value and structure so you only keep what truly serves you."

"I can't afford now."
- "No problem. We'll keep this properly prepared and revisit when affordability improves."

"Why all these details?"
- "Because correct details protect your family at claim stage and prevent delays."

17) Closing Script (High-Integrity Close)
"Let's do a final check together: your details, cover, beneficiaries, and deductions are all confirmed. If you're happy, we capture your signature and submit so your policy can be issued correctly."

18) One-line Principle
Matla Plan success is not just about selling a policy; it's about issuing the right policy, correctly, with full client understanding and clean compliance evidence.`
